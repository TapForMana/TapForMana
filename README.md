- 👋 Hi, I’m @TapForMana 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and programming! I am a beginner at this, but will soon be able to code the world!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on literally anything. I'd like to move into a web developer role, but I don't have any networks available to me.
